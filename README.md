AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY TO BRING KINGS FANS TOGETHER AT GAMES

---
## What is FanScoop?
- FanScoop is a car-sharing feature that enables Kings fans to coordinate carpools to games. 
- The biggest headaches when going to games are traffic, parking,  and looking people to go with.
- By rewarding drivers with parking and arena promotions,  FanScoop enables the Kings app to solve all of these problems.
- It encourages users to connect and stay in touch, building communities of fans who will continue going to games together.

## More than a ride-sharing service
- Sports is about community.
- Watching a game alone at home is a completely different experience from watching at a place full of fans.
- Users are not just any strangers. They are people who share a common passion for basketball and are about to watch the same game.
- Users will hype each other up, build community, and enhance each otherâ€™s experience.
